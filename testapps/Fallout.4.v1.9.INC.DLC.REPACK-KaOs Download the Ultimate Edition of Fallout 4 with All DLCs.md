The game features a vast and immersive world, a branching storyline, a dynamic dialogue system, a crafting and settlement-building system, and hundreds of hours of gameplay. The game also includes six downloadable content (DLC) packs that add new quests, locations, factions, weapons, armor, and features to the game.
 
However, Fallout 4 is also a very large and demanding game that requires a lot of disk space and system resources to run smoothly. The original release of the game was about 26 GB in size, and with all the DLCs and updates, it grew to about 47 GB.
 
That's why some repackers have created compressed versions of the game that reduce its size significantly without compromising its quality or functionality. One of these repacks is Fallout 4 v1.9 INC DLC REPACK-KaOs, which was released in 2019.
 
This repack is based on the CODEX ISO release of Fallout 4, with all the updates and language packs installed up to v1.9. It also includes all the DLCs and the Creation Kit v1.8.10. The repack uses a lossless compression method that removes the multilanguage audiotracks from the game videos and installs them on the user's machine based on their language selection.
 
The result is a repack that is only about 21 GB in size for any single language, which is less than half of the original size. The installation time is also reduced to about an hour on an average PC. The repack also offers alternative cracks from 3DM and ALI213 in case the CODEX crack doesn't work.
