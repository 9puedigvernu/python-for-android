## How to Hack the Railworks TS2016 DTG DB BR 648 Loco Add-On
  
The first step to hack the Railworks TS2016 DTG DB BR 648 Loco Add-On is to locate the game files on your computer.

The second step is to use a suitable program to open and edit the files. For example, you can use Notepad++ to edit text files, Audacity to edit audio files, Paint.NET to edit image files, etc. You can also use a hex editor to edit binary files, but this requires more advanced skills and knowledge.

You can also replace some audio files with your own sounds or music. You can also change some image files to alter the color scheme or logo of the train.
  
The fourth step is to save your changes and test them in the game. You can launch Railworks TS2016 and select the DTG DB BR 648 Loco Add-On from the menu. You can then choose one of the scenarios or create your own custom scenario with the train editor. You can then drive the train and see how it behaves with your modifications.
