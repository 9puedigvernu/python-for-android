# Breaking Bad Season 3 Complete 720p.brrip.sujaidr: A Review
 
Breaking Bad is one of the most acclaimed and popular TV shows of all time, and for good reason. The show follows the transformation of Walter White, a mild-mannered chemistry teacher who turns to cooking methamphetamine to secure his family's future after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. Along the way, he faces various challenges and enemies, both in the drug world and in his personal life.
 
Season 3 of Breaking Bad is arguably the best season of the series, as it ramps up the tension and drama to new heights. Walter and his partner Jesse have to deal with the consequences of their actions in the previous season, as well as the arrival of two ruthless hitmen from a Mexican cartel who are after them. Meanwhile, Walter's wife Skyler discovers his secret and decides to file for divorce, while his brother-in-law Hank, a DEA agent, gets closer to uncovering the truth.
