## Step 1: Find out your graphics card model
 
To download the correct OpenGL driver for your graphics card, you need to know the exact model of your card. You can use the Device Manager tool in Windows XP to find out this information. Here are the steps:
 
1. Click on the Start button and select Run.
2. Type `devmgmt.msc` in the Run box and press Enter.
3. In the Device Manager window, expand the Display adapters category.
4. You should see the name of your graphics card listed under Display adapters. Write down or remember this name.

## Step 2: Check your current OpenGL version
 
To check if you already have OpenGL 2.0 or higher installed on your computer, you can use a free tool called OpenGL Extensions Viewer. This tool can display information about your OpenGL driver, such as the version, vendor, extensions, and capabilities. Here are the steps:
