Underworld Endless War is a 2011 animated film that serves as a prequel to the Underworld series. It consists of three short episodes that depict the origins and evolution of the centuries-long conflict between the vampires and the lycans. The film features the voice of Kate Beckinsale as Selene, the vampire death dealer who is the protagonist of the live-action films.
 
The first episode takes place in 1890, when Selene and her partner Andreas Tanis are sent by the vampire elder Viktor to eliminate a lycan den in Paris. There, they encounter two powerful lycans, Raze and Krandrill, who manage to escape. The second episode is set in 1967, when Selene and Tanis return to Paris to hunt down the same lycans, who have allied with a human crime lord named Kahn. The third episode occurs in 2011, when Selene tracks down Raze and Krandrill for the final time, while also dealing with a new threat: a human SWAT team that has been hired by Kahn's son to wipe out both vampires and lycans.
