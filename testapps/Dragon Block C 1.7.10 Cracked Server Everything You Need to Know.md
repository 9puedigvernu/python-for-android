Dragon Block C is a mod for Minecraft that adds many features from the Dragon Ball Z anime series, such as new items, abilities, transformations, races, and more. If you are a fan of Dragon Ball Z and Minecraft, you might want to join a Dragon Block C server and play with other players who share your passion.
 
However, not everyone can afford to buy a premium Minecraft account or a server hosting service. That's why some players resort to using cracked versions of Minecraft and Dragon Block C, which allow them to play for free without authentication. Cracked servers are servers that accept cracked clients, meaning they don't check if the player has a valid Minecraft account.
