## Pandaga Chesko Movie Review: A Formulaic Family Entertainer
 
Pandaga Chesko is a movie that does not offer anything new in terms of story or treatment, but relies on the star power of Ram and the comedy of Brahmanandam to entertain the audience. The movie is a typical family entertainer that has all the elements of romance, drama, action and sentiment. The movie is directed by Gopichand Malineni, who has earlier made films like Don Seenu and Balupu.
 
The movie starts off with Karthik (Ram), a successful businessman in Portugal, who is engaged to Anushka (Sonal Chauhan), another rich heiress. However, he has to come to India to solve a problem in his factory, which is opposed by Divya (Rakul Preet Singh), an environmental activist and the daughter of his uncle Sai Reddy (Sai Kumar). Karthik decides to reunite his estranged family and also win Divya's heart in the process. He takes the help of Weekend Venkat Rao (Brahmanandam), a marriage broker who has a personal grudge against Sai Reddy. How Karthik succeeds in his mission forms the rest of the story.
 
The movie has a predictable plot and a routine screenplay, but it manages to keep the audience engaged with some witty dialogues and funny scenes. Ram is energetic and charming as usual and carries the film on his shoulders. He excels in both comedy and action scenes and also shows his dancing skills. Rakul Preet Singh is gorgeous and delivers a decent performance as Divya. She shares a good chemistry with Ram and also sizzles in the songs. Sonal Chauhan has a limited role but adds glamour to the screen. Brahmanandam is hilarious as Weekend Venkat Rao and provides some comic relief. The scenes between him and Ram are enjoyable. The other supporting actors like Sai Kumar, Rao Ramesh, Sampath Raj, MS Narayana, Vennela Kishore etc do their parts well.
 
The music by Thaman is average and none of the songs are memorable. The background score is loud and repetitive. The cinematography by Sameer Reddy is good and captures the scenic locations of Portugal and India. The editing by Gowtham Raju could have been better as the movie drags in some parts. The production values by United Movies are grand and lavish.
 
On the whole, Pandaga Chesko is a movie that does not offer anything new or innovative, but delivers what it promises - a formulaic family entertainer that can be watched once for Ram's performance and Brahmanandam's comedy.
