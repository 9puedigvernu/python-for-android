In this article, we will explain the difference between 720p and 1080i, and how they affect the viewing experience of Prey. We will also give you some tips on how to choose the best resolution for your TV and preferences.
 
## What Is 720p?
 
720p is a high-definition video resolution that has 1280 pixels by 720 lines. The "p" stands for progressive scan, which means that each line of pixels is drawn on the screen in one pass. This results in a smooth and clear picture, especially for fast-moving scenes. The total number of pixels displayed on a 720p screen is 921,600[^1^].
 
## What Is 1080i?
 
1080i is another high-definition video resolution that has 1920 pixels by 1080 lines. The "i" stands for interlaced scan, which means that each line of pixels is split into two groups of 540 lines each. The first group of lines is drawn on the screen, followed by the second group of lines. This alternates every 60th of a second (or twice every 30th of a second). The total number of pixels displayed on a complete 1080i screen is 2,073,600[^2^]. However, only about half of that is sent every 60th of a second[^3^].
 
## Which One Is Better: 720p or 1080i?
 
The answer to this question depends on several factors, such as the type of content, the size and quality of your TV, and your personal preference. Here are some pros and cons of each resolution:

However, if you are watching Prey on a larger screen (more than 32 inches) or from a far distance (more than six feet), you may prefer 1080i for its higher resolution and detail.
