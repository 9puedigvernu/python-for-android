Tricalc Con is a software that allows engineers and architects to perform structural analysis and design of various types of buildings and structures. Tricalc Con is based on the finite element method, which can handle complex geometries, loads, materials, and boundary conditions. Tricalc Con can also generate detailed reports, drawings, and calculations for each project.

One of the main features of Tricalc Con is that it allows users to add their own custom elements, materials, loads, and design criteria. Users can create and modify their own libraries of elements, such as beams, columns, slabs, walls, foundations, etc. Users can also define their own material properties, such as elasticity, plasticity, creep, fatigue, etc. Users can also specify their own load cases, such as dead load, live load, wind load, seismic load, etc. Users can also set their own design standards, such as Eurocode, ACI, AISC, etc.
 
By adding their own custom data, users can tailor Tricalc Con to their specific needs and preferences. Users can also share their custom data with other users through the online platform of Tricalc Con. This way, users can benefit from the collective knowledge and experience of the Tricalc Con community.
 
Tricalc Con is a powerful and versatile software that can help engineers and architects to design safe and efficient structures. Tricalc Con is compatible with Windows and Mac operating systems. Tricalc Con also offers a free trial version for users who want to test its features and capabilities.

Another feature of Tricalc Con is that it can handle different types of structures and materials, such as concrete, steel, wood, masonry, composite, light steel framing (LSF), and scaffolding. Tricalc Con has different modules for each type of structure and material, which can be combined and integrated in the same project. Tricalc Con can also perform advanced analysis and design for seismic actions, fire resistance, dynamic effects, nonlinear behavior, etc.
